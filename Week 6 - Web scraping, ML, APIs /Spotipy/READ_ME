# Project Title: 

Song recommender 

## Description

The objective of this one week project was to build a song recommender based on user input, applying webs-scraping, API and Machine Learning
techniques.
My model should cross-check user input against the Billboard Hot 100 to designate a song as "hot" or not "hot". 
If the song is designated "hot", my model should recommend users another random song from the Billboard Hot 100. 
If the song is not designated "hot", my model should retrive the audio features of the song by querying Spotify through an API, 
predict a cluster of the song based on the dataframe (approx. 3000 songs) on which I trained my model and recommend users a random song
from the predicted cluster. 

## The key files in this repository are: 

- ipynb Notebooks: 

  - MVP_Song_Recommender.ipynb is where you find my song recommender 
  - Other Notebooks which show both my working and how I built the dataframes can be viewed in the Archives folder 

- CSVs:

These are all CSVs created by exporting dataframes I built. I exported them to CSV for re-usability across Notebooks: 
  - billboard_hot_100_df.csv
  - my_music.csv
  - my_music_training_data.csv
